# circleci finds setup.py and thinks I want to run it. I actually want, but not at this
# stage, so I override dependencies and just install the requirements.
dependencies:
  override:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

checkout:
  post:
    - git submodule init
    - git submodule update

test:
